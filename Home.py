           **Disclaimer:** 
           
           The data in this app comes from two public datasets: the [Chord Progression Assistant](https://github.com/jhamer90811/chord_progression_assistant) and [the Spotify Million Song Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset). These datasets provide a limited perspective and do not cover the full spectrum of music data. The analyses and insights offered by this app may not fully represent the music landscape and could contain inherent biases. Users are advised to consider these limitations when interpreting the app's outputs.

# Project Context
st.subheader('Project Context')
st.write("""
    Music transcends mere auditory enjoyment, acting as a powerful catalyst for emotions, memories, and collective sentiments. The intricate dance of lyrics and chord progressions reveals the essence of a song's ambiance. This synergy is crucial not only for academic study but also for record labels seeking bands that resonate with diverse audiences. At the heart of this exploration is the relationship between lyrics and the emotions they evoke. Understanding the complex tapestry of music, however, extends beyond subjective interpretation and into the realm of quantitative analysis.
    
    This project employs visualizations to explore numerical features like tempo, key, and chord progression, alongside textual elements. By quantifying these aspects, we uncover patterns and trends in music. Additionally, radar graphs offer a nuanced understanding of the musical and lyrical kinship between songs, aiding both academic and practical applications in the music industry.
    
    Ultimately, this project aims to unravel the science behind the art of music, shedding light on how various elements of a song coalesce to impact its listeners.

# Key Variables
st.subheader('Key Variables')
st.write("""
    Several key variables are crucial in understanding a track's appeal. Danceability, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, tempo, duration, time signature, and valence each play a role in the character of a song. These variables, along with chord progression and textual analysis, help in exploring musical patterns and emotional resonance. Our app visualizes these aspects to offer a comprehensive view of a song's characteristics.
